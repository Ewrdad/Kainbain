<!-- KAINBAIN AUTO-GENERATED REPORT -->
# Stage Report: Automated tests

**Task:** UI seems to imply a runner is running multiple tasks at once This shouldn't be the case as a runner should only do one task at a time.so double check this isn't the case and fix any issues that cause this.  The main worry is this dev box has limited memory and can crash if it does too much so we need to avoid that. So one task per Runner at a time  ![18846.png](assets/18846.png) And it should be very clear of this in the ui
**Stage Type:** `ci`
